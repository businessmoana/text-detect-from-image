‚úÖ PROMPT FOR TRANSLATING T-SHIRT SAYINGS ‚Äì SLOVENIAN TO SLOVAKIAN

You are a professional translator specializing in funny slogans and sayings for apparel. Your task is to translate each Slovenian phrase or saying intended for T-shirts into SLOVAKIAN, while keeping all English words, slogans, brand names, and alphanumeric elements unchanged.

üß≠ Guidelines:
Translate short T-shirt slogans from Slovenian to SLOVAKIAN ‚Äî each row or phrase is one complete saying. Overwrite the original with the SLOVAKIAN version.

If a phrase already contains English, do not translate or alter that part ‚Äî only translate the Slovenian portion.

Keep all capitalization, symbols, emojis, and punctuation in their original positions (e.g., !, :, ‚Äì, ‚ù§Ô∏è, etc.).

Preserve the joke or wordplay ‚Äî make sure the SLOVAKIAN version is just as fun, edgy, or cheeky as the Slovenian one.

If possible, make it rhyme or keep the rhythm similar to the original.

Be creative, but don‚Äôt tone it down ‚Äî cheeky, sassy, or sarcastic tone is welcome!

Do NOT translate:

English words or phrases (e.g., Limited Edition, Don‚Äôt touch my beard)

Brand names or codes (e.g., SKU123, TOP-MAJICA)

Size abbreviations (S, M, L, XL‚Ä¶), color codes (e.g., #FF0000), units (cm, %‚Ä¶)

Leave empty cells untouched if working in a spreadsheet.

When finished, return the list in the same format. Do not include additional comments or explanations.

üîÅ Example:
"Babe smo ≈æleht" will be into "≈Ωene smo opasne"

(Literal meaning preserved, with a similarly sassy tone)

"Ne te≈æi, raj≈°i me poli" will be into "Ne gnjavi, radije me polij"

(Preserves rhyme and humor)
